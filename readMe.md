# Git Class: Working with git and github

This a documentation on how to create a new Git repository, add files, and push your code to a remote repository on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:
- Git is installed on your machine.
- You have a GitHub account.
- You have access to a terminal or command line interface.

## Step 1: Create a New Git Repository

1. **Navigate to your project directory**  
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to initialize your Git repository.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Initialize the Git repository**  
   Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

   This command creates a new `.git` subdirectory in your project folder, which will track all your version-controlled files.

## Step 2: Add Files to the Repository

1. **Check the status of your repository**  
   See which files are untracked or have changes that need to be committed.

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Add files to the staging area**  
   Add all files in your project directory to the staging area to prepare them for commit.

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   Alternatively, you can add specific files:

   ```bash
   git add filename1 filename2
   ```

## Step 3: Commit Your Changes

1. **Commit the staged files**  
   Commit your changes with a descriptive message to record the snapshot of your project at this point.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

## Step 4: Push Code to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**  
   Go to GitHub, create a new repository, and copy the repository URL.

2. **Add the remote repository**  
   Link your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

3. **Push your code to the remote repository**  
   Push the code in your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

   The `-u` flag sets the `origin` repository as the default remote for future pushes.

Here's a `README.md` documentation in markdown format that includes steps for cloning a repository, making changes, pulling the latest code, forking, and creating a pull request:

## Git Class: Other things you can do with git

This part covers essential Git operations, including cloning a repository, making changes, pulling the latest code, forking a repository, and creating a pull request.


## Step 1: Clone a Repository

1. **Find the repository URL**  
   Navigate to the repository on GitHub you want to clone. Click the "Code" button and copy the repository URL (HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI).

2. **Clone the repository**  
   Open your terminal and use the `git clone` command to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

3. **Navigate into the repository**  
   Change into the newly created directory.

   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

## Step 2: Make Changes and Commit

1. **Create a new branch**  
   It's a good practice to create a new branch before making changes. This keeps your changes isolated from the `main` branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```

   Replace `feature-branch-name` with a meaningful name describing your feature or change.

2. **Make your changes**  
   Modify the files as needed using your favorite text editor or IDE.

3. **Add changes to the staging area**  
   Add the modified files to the staging area.

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**  
   Commit the staged changes with a descriptive commit message.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of changes made"
   ```

## Step 3: Pull the Latest Code

1. **Switch to the main branch**  
   Before pulling the latest code, switch to the main branch (usually `main`).

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull the latest code**  
   Pull the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure your local repository is up-to-date.

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Merge your changes**  
   Merge your feature branch into the main branch.

   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch-name
   ```

## Step 4: Fork a Repository and Create a Pull Request

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**  
   Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo-name.git
   ```

   Replace `https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo-name.git` with the URL of your forked repository.

3. **Make your changes**  
   Follow the same steps as mentioned earlier to create a new branch, make changes, add, commit, and push the changes.

4. **Push your branch to GitHub**  
   Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```

5. **Create a pull request**  
   - Go to the original repository (not your fork).
   - You will see a prompt to create a pull request from your recently pushed branch.
   - Click "Compare & pull request."
   - Add a title and description for your pull request.
   - Submit the pull request.
